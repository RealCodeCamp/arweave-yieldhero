# Yield Hero: easily swap collateral between different aTokens to get the best yield

You can access this on [Arweave](https://arweave.net/Q-J6Vq7Y0BvGAlN_BQJYfiM7TDWBUzKGxzN0kjzoIiA).

I have ported Yield Hero to Arweave. As part of [Port a dApp UI to Arweave](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/Bounties/issues/28) bounty. 
I made some modifications on Yield Hero to make it compatible with Arweave command line tool.



## Yield Hero:
The main idea of Yield Hero is to let you easily swap collateral between different aTokens to get the best yield.

Yield Hero is powered by a Balancer pool.

Kovan pool: https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x8f7F78080219d4066A8036ccD30D588B416a40DB
Mainnet pool:https://etherscan.io/address/0x2feb4a6322432cbe44dc54a4959ac141ece53d7c
